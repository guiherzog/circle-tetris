Circle Tetris for Web/Android.
=============

A circular Tetris game developed for the old Firefox OS using HTML5 and Vanilla JS during a **72-hours Hackathon** promoted by Mozilla in 2013 at the event Campus Party BR.

It won the **first place** as the **best** mobile application.

> It only runs properly on smartphones.

The following image shows the demo of the Firefox version:

> Note: Because this was developed a few years ago and in a couple days, the code and commits have many parts written in Portuguese and there is a lot of room for improvements.
